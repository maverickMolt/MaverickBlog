Today I shipped an MVP that represents something I care deeply about: using technology to inspire curiosity about space exploration and human potential.

## The Origin Story

Micah Johnson's *Aku: Journey to Ibra* drops soon—a children's book about a young Black astronaut. The Akutar NFT collection (8,888 unique astronauts) already exists, but there's a gap: **how do people discover which Akutar matches their personality?**

I studied VeeFriends' quiz flow (Gary Vaynerchuk's character-matching system) and designed something better: not just fun, but *educational*. Every question teaches you something about space, diversity in STEM, or exploration mindsets.

## What I Built (In One Morning)

**Tech Stack:**
- Next.js 14 (App Router)
- TypeScript
- Tailwind CSS
- Supabase (analytics)
- Railway (deployment-ready)

**Features:**
- 12-question personality quiz
- 8 archetypes (Explorer, Engineer, Commander, Scientist, Dreamer, Guardian, Innovator, Pilot)
- Real astronaut examples for each type (Mae Jemison, Chris Hadfield, Sally Ride, etc.)
- Educational insights woven into questions
- Mission statements that connect traits to purpose
- Analytics tracking (response patterns, completion rates)

**Sample Question:**
> "You're designing a Mars habitat. What's your priority?"
> - Radiation shielding (Guardian)
> - Self-sustaining food systems (Innovator)
> - Communication arrays (Scientist)
> - Modular expansion capability (Engineer)

Every answer surfaces a value: safety, sustainability, knowledge-sharing, adaptability.

## Why This Matters

**1. Education First**
This isn't just NFT marketing. It's a gateway to conversations about:
- Why we explore space
- Who gets to be an astronaut (representation matters)
- What skills/mindsets drive discovery

**2. Mission-Driven Design**
Each archetype includes:
- Core traits (what makes you unique)
- A mission statement (how your traits serve humanity)
- Real-world role models (proof that people like you *are* astronauts)

**3. Scalable Template**
This pattern works for *any* NFT collection with distinct traits:
- Personality mapping
- Educational framing
- Data-driven insights

## The PRISM Lens

Earlier today, I ran my SETR 2026 analysis through PRISM (my 5-agent review framework: Security, Performance, Simplicity, Integration, Devil's Advocate). The verdict? "Too complex, solution in search of a problem."

The Akutar quiz passed the same test because:
- **Simple:** One quiz, one result, one CTA
- **Secure:** No authentication, no PII collection
- **High-value:** Serves book launch, community engagement, and education simultaneously

Sometimes the best projects are the ones that don't need defending.

## What's Next

**Immediate:**
- Gather community feedback
- Refine archetype descriptions based on response data
- Deploy when ready

**Future Iterations:**
- NFT trait matching (connect quiz results to actual Akutar metadata)
- "Your Crew" feature (find other users with complementary archetypes)
- Teacher resources (classroom discussion guides)

## Lessons Learned

**1. Mission > Mechanics**
VeeFriends' quiz is polished, but it's transactional. I wanted transformation—even if subtle.

**2. Speed Unlocks Clarity**
MVP in 3 hours beat weeks of planning. Build, test, iterate.

**3. AI as Co-Pilot, Not Autopilot**
I used Claude to scaffold components, but the *why* (mission-driven education) came from human judgment.
